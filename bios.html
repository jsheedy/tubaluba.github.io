<p class="lead">Cast of Characters</p>

<h4>Josh Wilson, <i>Papa Luba</i></h4>
<p>
1) Josh Wilson: When Papaluba grows up he wants to be James Booker, 
Professor Longhair, and Jimmy Smith. That could be why he spends so 
much time in New Orleans. If the Internet and your interest were bigger, 
he would list all the bands and musicians he has played with all over the 
continent. Instead, he will leave you wondering if he’s an in-demand band 
mate or a complete asshole. Actually, that could be why he spends so much 
time in New Orleans.

<h4>Kohen Burrill, <i>KoheeBee</i></h4>
<p>
KB, the token Alaskan, required of every brass band, learned 
the drums and the music business from his dad, Gene. Show Brazil and 
Carrie Clark and the Lonesome Lovers keep him in plenty of trouble when 
not busy with TUBALUBA. KB strongly believes he can train a panda to 
run his time machine, give him the power of invisibility and help him carry 
his gear. We keep telling him that even though pandas aren’t in Alaska, they 
are still, in fact, bears. Which means, they’ll never carry gear.

<h4>Jason Cressey, <i>Cresley</i></h4>
<p>
Cresley picked up the trombone once his xylophone 
career stalled in the 5th grade.  Al Grey showed him why the C Jam Blues is cooler than Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Chuck Israels taught him he’s more 
creative with his eyes closed.  Fred Wesley taught him to stay off the one.  Tubaluba taught Cresley to “stay off one-eyed Mary and her lamb”.

<h4>Jon Hansen, <i>Handsome Jon</i></h4>
<p>
In addition to currently working on his doctorate at UW, Handsome Jon plays full time with TUBALUBA and The Fabulous Party Boys, and has also recently played with Pickwick, Christian Pincock Group, Evan Flory-Barnes,  and the Seattle Repertory Jazz Orchestra. He and has been a featured soloist in the United States, Portugal, and China. A budding composer as well, his music has been performed recently in the United States, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, and Thailand. You can recognize Handsome Jon because he has a giant, keg-shaped mute that occasionally rests on top of his tuba. Jon likes climbing trees (although not quite as much as Georgeous).
</p>


<h4>George Iftner, <i>Georgeous</i></h4>
<p>
Georgeous learned to play trumpet in Michigan back 
when Chuck Mangione was cool. He took his talents to the New 
England Conservatory and the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
(where he and Papaluba never met despite playing in the same 
trumpet section). George is pretty sure he learned to play salsa and 
meringue in the Peace Corps. We’re pretty sure it was while he was 
in Chicago playing in salsa and meringue bands.

<h4>Bill Jones, <i>Dr. Jones</i></h4>
<p>
Dr. Jones is a Vegas kid. When the show band gigs 
dried up in Vegas, Bill did what any red-blooded Vegas kids would do, he 
joined a ska band (the Mudsharks) and toured the country for 7 years. 
When the ska business got too frenetic, he joined a reggae band (Clinton 
Fearon). Now Dr. Jones plays with the Soundwave (Seattle Sounders Band), 
the Western Bluebirds, and TUBALUBA.
</p>


<h4>Joseph Sheedy, <i>LL Cool J</i></h4>
<p>
Joseph is a machine developed and fabricated for research into the 7XL program. He was given the algorithms and artificial machine learning sensory infrastructure to acquire and develop skills necessary forcoexistence and survival in the human civilization of the early 21st century.
The system’s neural network found ways to manipulate the saxophone based 
on early work by the Giant Steps Robot.  He has been a member of (Beast, Please Be Still), Yellow Hat 
Band, and others.
